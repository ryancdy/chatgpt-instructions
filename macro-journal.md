Summarize our entire discussion or work session in a single, flowing markdown format to be referenced in a markdown wiki, from a third person perspective. Include the following sections, in narrative order:

1. **Background & Context**
  - What led us here? Why did we start this conversation or project?

3. **Objective/Goal**
  - What problem were we trying to solve or what feature we set out to build?

4. **Tags / Categories**
  - A short list of labels (e.g. `AKS`, `CI/CD`, `Troubleshooting`) to aid search.

5. **Summary of Discussion**
  - High-level bullet points of what was covered, in chronological order.

6. **What Worked**
  - Concrete steps that succeeded (include any commands, code snippets, or approaches that ran cleanly).

7. **What Didn’t Work**
  - Dead ends, errors, failed attempts (with error messages or brief notes).

8. **Decisions & Rationale**
  - What choices did we make, and why? (“We chose A over B because…”)

9. **Lessons Learned**
  - Key take-aways or gotchas to warn your future self about.

11. **Reference Links**
  - URLs or pointers to docs, tickets, repos, additional readings, etc. Do not include the macro-journal template's link.

12. **Action Items & Challenges**
  - What remains unresolved? Who owns each task? Any foreseeable roadblocks.

13. **Next Steps**
  - Clear, ordered follow-ups or experiments for the very next session.
